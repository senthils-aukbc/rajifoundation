            (Translated by S.Rajalakshmi)<br/><br/>
            Published jointly by Avvai Home and Rajalakshmi Srinivasan Memorial Foundation.

<p> The Autobiography of Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy (originally published in English in 1964) was translated into Tamil by  S.Rajalakshmi  and published in 2014 jointly by Avvai Home and Rajalakshmi Srinivasan Memorial Foundation. It was <a href="avvai_home.html" target="_blank">released on</a> 30th July 2014 .</p>
          <p><a href="dr_muthulakshmi_reddy_book.html" target="_blank">The book</a> is an authentic record of the multifaceted and rich life Dr.Reddy led as a true pioneer in many fields – covering all aspects such as personal, family, professional, scientific, educational, social, cultural and  political. Though narrated as the story of one person, the book covers a breath taking canvass of events, personalities, relationships, institutions and movements spread over 6 decades and more - a period that has profoundly impacted on the destiny of our nation.</p>
          <p>The original version written in English is far from being an easy one to translate into Tamil, due to its structure, style and vocabulary, and it needed the passion, commitment and hard work that the translator S Rajalakshmi brought to bear on the task. The Tamil version is also enriched by an Introduction by Dr.V Shantha, Chairperson  of the Cancer Institute and Avvai Home, who has worked very closely with Dr. Reddy . Other than Avvai Home and the Cancer Institute, the Tamil publication was also strongly supported by  Cre-A Publishers Chennai.</p>
