      <p>
        The story cards project was originally started in 2003 in Tamil Nadu to promote reading habits among children
        studying in Tamil-medium schools.
      </p>

      <h4>Why stories?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A large number of children in rural schools are first generation learners. Text books are the only reading
          material available to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          In order for children to become good readers they should have access to a wide range of reading materials.
        </li>
        <li>Activities that are rich in context engage the attention of children effortlessly.</li>
        <li>
          Stories handled sensitively provide the most fertile ground for the children’s imagination and expression.
          Stories widen their horizons and deepen their understanding.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Format of the story cards</h4>
      <p>
        The stories were brought out in laminated A3-size cards. The card format is ideal 
        for shared reading in a classroom. The cards are easy to handle and can withstand
        frequent use, ensuring that several groups of children in a classroom may use them
        simultaneously.

      <h4>The stories</h4>
      <p>
        The set includes not only folk stories but also historical, humorous, mythological,
        science-based and contemporary stories– that highlight the richness and variety
        of our Indian tradition.
      </p>

      <h4>Translations into other languages</h4>
      <p>
        The story cards were originally brought out by a team of four educationists Ms. P.
        Saraswati, Ms. V.Vijayakanthi, Dr. L.S. Saraswathi and Ms. S. Rajalakshmi. Titled
        ‘Kathai Aruvi’, the Tamil cards were published in 2003 by Chatnath Trust.
        Kathai Aruvi caught the attention of other educationists from all over India and
        requests to translate them into Hindi and other languages were recieved. The Hindi
        version was published in 2008 and the Kannada, Gujarati and Oriya story cards 
        were published subsequently. 
      </p>

        refining the Hindi translations. Our heartfelt thanks to the following team of
        educationists and writers without whose support and valuable inputs the Hindi
        publication Katha Jharna would not have become a reality:
