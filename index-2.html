<p> Rajalakshmi Srinivasan Memorial Foundation came into being to celebrate the vision an work of Prof.Rajalakshmi Srinivasan(<a href="about.html" target="_self">Raji</a>) and keep alive the spirit that she represented. A multifaceted personality, Raji donned the roles of a friend, mentor, guide, teacher, administrator, women’s activist, social worker and leader with ease. Exuding positivity, she lifted the spirits of all who came in touch with her, and occupies a unique place in their hearts.</p>
          <p>It is to affirm this spirit of Raji that Rajalakshmi Srinivasan Memorial Foundation was set up. The Foundation furthers the charitable and public service projects initiated by Raji and takes up new projects aligned to her vision and goals as described <a href="interestareas.html" target="_self">here.</a> The main field of its activity is Education at various levels like schools, colleges, universities, training institutes etc, and the Foundation believes that proper education is a key to empowerment, be that of an individual or society or nation. While all aspects of education, including research and application, are of interest to the Foundation, it lays special emphasis on how education can empower and uplift the underprivileged sections who are economically and socially weak.</p>
