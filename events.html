              <p><b>2. <u>Foundation Launch Function </u>: Wed the 28th May 2014</b></p>
              <p align="justify"> Raji Foundation would be formally launched on Wed. 28th May, 2014, and thereafter this date will be celebrated annually as the Foundation Day.
The occasion would be used to create some public awareness about our Trust and its programs, as well as help generate inputs for finalizing our work  programs in the field of School Education for the Disadvantaged Sections.</p>
<p><b><center><u>The Program</u></center></b></p>
<p> <b><u>Date and time:</u></b> Wednesday the 28th May 2014, 9.30 AM  to 3.0PM</p>
<p> <b><u>Venue:</u></b> Adyar Shastri Nagar Welfare Association Hall, 18/11, 5th Cross Street, Shastri Nagar, Adyar , Chennai – 600020 . Ph. 044-24460822.</p>
<p><b><u>Agenda:</u></b>
<ul class="section-list" style="list-style-position: inside;"> 
<li>9.30 – 10.30 AM: Formal Launch Function of the Foundation</li>
<li>10.30 – 11.00 AM: Tea Break</li>
<li>11.00 AM – 1.00 PM : Meeting with representatives of Schools for the Disadvantaged Sections.</li>
<li>1.00 – 2.00 PM : Lunch</li>
<li>2.0 – 3.0 PM : Meeting of Trustees and volunteers to consolidate the inputs and formulate plans.</li>

</ul>
<p><b><u>Goal of the Meeting with School Representatives:</u></b></p>
<p align="justify">This would be a meeting with representatives of the schools/homes for the poor from in and around Chennai, in which we will explain about RSMF background, purpose and goals, and seek from them inputs on the kind of support that they would like us to extend to them. There are broadly two types of engagements RSMF could have with them: </p>
<ul>
<li> <p align="justify">Engaging with them in improving their ongoing teaching-learning processes within their schools – through providing additional coaching in the required subjects; extracurricular/ co-curricular/ creative  activities; language, communication skills and personality development, etc.</p></li>
<li><p align="justify">Preparing and supporting the children for life beyond the school – opportunities for higher studies, careers, vocations, skills, employment etc that they can pursue after they pass out of the school. 
We would get the inputs from the school representatives on the kind of specific engagements they would like to have with the Foundation in these two areas. This input would form part of the basis for our future programs in this domain, as well as we will be able to identify institutions and individuals with whom we could be working , beyond  our primary engagement with Avvai Home.</p> </li>

              From the first week of July 2014 onwards, we have been conducting English and Mathematics classes for 
              the classes 6,7 and 8 of Avvai Home from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. on all working days with the assistance of  
              volunteers from Ethiraj College for Women. The aim of these classes is to develop language and communication 
              skills of the students and to make learning  mathematics more effective and interesting. There were 20 volunteers 
              involved in it who taught for two months, July and August, after which another batch of volunteers 
              from Ethiraj College were taking over. The program initially ran throughout the year. 
              At present, classes are being taken for Avvai Home students of classes 11 and 12 from 5.30 to 7.30PM with 
              the help of volunteers with the goal of preparing them for their Board exams as well as giving them career 
              counselling
